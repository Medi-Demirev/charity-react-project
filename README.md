# Getting Started with Create React App

# About the Project

This is a defense project for the ReactJS course at SoftUni.

To start the project:

Open the server folder in integrated terminal and type node server.js

Open the client folder in integrated terminal and type :

npm i - command installs a package and any packages that it depends on.

npm start- To start the react project in localhost:3000.

For backend i'm using https://github.com/softuni-practice-server/softuni-practice-server

For the needs of the project, new collections have been added to the finished server. 
The server is hosted at the following address:https://api-kindness.herokuapp.com/. 
If you want to use it locally, the base URL must be changed from https://api-kindness.herokuapp.com/ to http://localhost:3000/.

# HOME PAGE

(./home.png)
Kindness is an app that aims to create Charitable causes and events to help people in need.Provides an opportunity to register two types of users with different rights.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Installing Dependencies
The current repository already includes a node_modules folder with everything necessary. To manually install all necessary dependencies run the following in the console in the main directory and in /src:

npm i

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
